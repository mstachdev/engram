6/27/2025:
in new york, 
another fast summer, 
time flying, 
trying to be careful about how to spend time, 
weary of it passing without events,
progress is difficult,
one good step is a planned vacation with parents july 6-9 in maine,
they've never been to maine.
started taking humira,
joints worse,
even knees hurt when stretching,
which is a new one.
up to 8 miles.
maintaining anki for 11 months now.
hangboarding after lifting is a bad idea.

Its my last night in new york,
this app will not be like bythefire,
it will be focused.
time is spent on the function.
priority is getting it on phones and used by friend.
second priority is getting the AI working.
this is to learn about building application using LLMs rather than the UI, or story, or vision

6/29/2025:
engram app is a step up
previous app bythefire was just front end
this is at least 3x more complicated 
front end, backend, inference server
frontend will be simpler
backend functions take inputs to app and process them
- processing can include passing to inference server for transformation
vllm server just processes requests
backend will grow in complexity - it is where the fancy llm glue will live
