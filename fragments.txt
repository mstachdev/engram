6/27/2025:
in new york, 
another fast summer, 
time flying, 
trying to be careful about how to spend time, 
weary of it passing without events,
progress is difficult,
one good step is a planned vacation with parents july 6-9 in maine,
they've never been to maine.
started taking humira,
joints worse,
even knees hurt when stretching,
which is a new one.
up to 8 miles.
maintaining anki for 11 months now.
hangboarding after lifting is a bad idea.
